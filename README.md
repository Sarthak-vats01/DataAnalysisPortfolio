# Data Analysis and Visualization Projects

## Python Projects

### Movies Correlation Analysis

In this Python project, we delve into the correlations in gross earnings of movies. The primary tasks include:

1. **Data Handling:**
   - Addressing missing values to ensure a robust analysis.
   - Eliminating duplicate entries for cleaner datasets.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Creating insightful visualizations to unravel the trends and patterns in movie earnings.

Explore the Jupyter notebook or Python script in the 'MovieAnalysis' directory for an in-depth analysis.

## MySQL Project

### Data Exploration with MySQL

In this MySQL project, the focus is on handling a substantial dataset with over 30,000 entries. The main steps involve:

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Creating an efficient table structure to store the dataset.

2. **Data Import:**
   - Importing the dataset into the MySQL database for further exploration.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducting a comprehensive analysis of the imported data using SQL queries.

Navigate to the 'MySQLProject' directory for the SQL scripts and additional details on the data exploration.
